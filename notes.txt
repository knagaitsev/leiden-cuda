Leiden notes:

- instead of each community immediately becoming a singleton as in the Louvain algorithm, allow the partition to be broken up into multiple nodes during refinement
    - rather than just being a single node with a self-edge as in Louvain


In Leiden we form the following layers:
- original graph -- orig
- singleton communities (initial iteration only) -- this becomes P (orig underlying)
- refined partition communities -- P_refined (orig underlying)
- partition of the refined partition (from what was found during MoveNodesFast) -- P (P_refined underlying)

In the next iteration:
- refined partition is the graph we operate on -- P_refined
- rather than forming singleton communities, use "partition of the refined partition" as communities for the next iteration -- this becomes P_2 (P_refined underlying)
- refined partition communities -- P_refined_2 (P_refined underlying)
- "partition of the refined partition" -- P_2 (P_refined_2 underlying)

So to propagate communities back to orig, we only need to propagate through from:
    - P_refined_2 -> P_refined -> orig

Note that "P" always has its corresponding P_refined underlying it. It is useful for passing the community information to the next Leiden iteration, but it is not needed for final community propagation
